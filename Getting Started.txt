														Support Deck Builder Set-Up Reference

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Thanks for downloading the Support Deck Builder!

Before proceeding, I must point out that this program has only been compiled for a Windows based system, and so I cannot assist non-Windows users at
this time.

The "Support Deck Builder.zip" file should include everything you need to successfully run this program. Inside the .zip should be five directories
("CharacterProfiles", "Data", "Output", "Source", and "UniqueProfiles"), two "readme" .txt files (including this one), and the executable
("Support Deck Builder.exe").
	

Follow these steps to ensure that the program will operate successfully:
	1) Unzip the contents to a local directory. I recommend placing the program into your User Directory (So for me, it would be placed into:
	Paz/Support Deck Builder). This ensures that the program will always have authority to write the output files it creates. If you're uncomfortable
	doing this with this program, then go ahead and download or copy the source code to compile and/or edit yourself.
	
	2) In the same Directory, check that there are five sub-directories: "CharacterProfiles"; "Data"; "Output"; "Source"; and "UniqueProfiles". If
	these directories do not exist, please create them (case sensitive, no spaces) before attempting to use the Support Deck Solver.
	
	3) Look inside the Data directory - there should be seven different files: 
		i) cardTypes.txt   ii) characterNames.txt   iii) numericTypes.txt   iv) supportCards.txt
		v) supportSkillLevels.txt   vi) supportSkills.txt   vii) "Support Deck Tables.xlsx"
		
	4) Look inside the "Source" directory - there should be six different files:
		i) main.cpp   ii) declarations.h   iii) classes.h
		iv) sort_algorithm.cpp   v) functions.cpp   vi) misc_functions.cpp

	5) If you do not see these files, either download them or copy the contents from GitHub. The first six files listed under "Data" are essential for the
	 program to operate properly - "Support Deck Tables.xlsx" is not necessary for the program's success. If you still cannot obtain a copy of the files,
	 send me PM via AppInvasion.
	 
	6) In the "CharacterProfiles" directory, there should be one sub-directory - "ExactProfiles". If this directory does not exist, go ahead and
	 create it (exactly as named, case sensitive and no spaces).
	 
	7) Once the six steps above are completed, if the program is located in your User Directory, go ahead and start up the program and follow the
	 instructions on-screen. If the program is located outside of your User Directory, It may be necessary to right click the executable and select
	 "Run as Administrator" to get the program to run as intended - however, this is only necessary to do if you want ensure that the program can
	 write output files.
	 
	8) Enjoy!

															Starting up the Program

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
	
Once you start the program, I recommend you resize your command window to be at least twice as large as the default size. Sometimes the onscreen output
will wrap around onto the next line or run off the side - if this doesn't bother you then continue.
	
There will be a very brief pause while the program loads and builds its databases.
Once it is complete, you will be presented with a single line of text:

		"Check combinations (1) or check stats (2) or print profile info (3) or Quit (0)?:  "

Entering "1" will launch the support deck solver, "2" will launch the statistics component, "3" will print out info about each character card, and "0"
will quit the application. After you make your initial choice, you will be prompted with more choices - simply follow the instructions provided.

Let's work our way through starting up the Support Deck solving component. We have just entered "1" into the command line. We are now prompted with
the following line:

		"How many skills (2 - 6) do you want in your support deck?:  "

The program will not proceed until you have entered an integer in the range described above. Once you have done so, the next line to appear is:

		"How many total cards (2 - 7) do you want in your deck?:  "

This line sets the limit on the number of extra cards that will be searched during the solving. The minimum value allowed is equal to the number of
skills you chose; the maximum is always the current max size of the support deck. This means if you choose 3 skills and then set a total deck size of
3, the program will search 0 additional cards - the combinations checked will be those of only the support skill cards with the desired skills.
If you had set total size to 4, the program would search 1 additional card for a total of 3 support skill cards + 1 non-skilled card. Following this
is the line:

		"Set a maximum cap cost? (Yes = 1): "

Entering anything except "1" will tell the program that you don't care about cap cost, while entering "1" will lead to the next prompt. Let's say we
entered "1" - we would now see:

		"Enter the desired maximum cap cost (not less than zero):  "

Here, you enter in your desired maximum cap cost; it can be "0" (which will return no combinations every time). The next line to appear is then:
	
		"Enforce minimum skill levels? (Yes = 1):   "
		
Entering "1" tells the program that you are searching for specific minimum levels of your skills. Otherwise entering any other value tells the program
that you're looking for any possible skill level combinations of your support skills. Next you will see:
		
		
		1) Ambush
		2) Battle Penalty Reduction
		3) Battle Reward Credit UP
		4) Call of the Light Side
		5) Character Card HP UP
		6) Lure of the Dark Side
		7) Prep Skill Nullification
		8) Prep Skill Trigger UP
		9) Proximity Alarm
		10) Undercover
		11) Anti Lightsaber Tactics
		
		"Please choose a skill:  "
	
The above last line comes with the displayed list of support skills. After choosing our skill, we would then be presented with a list of cards which
correspond to the chosen ability and asked if we wanted to ignore any of them during solving. For this, let's say we enter "1", which corresponds to
Ambush:

		1) 4* Agen Kolar
		2) 4* Shadow Trooper
		3) 4* Wicket W Warrick
		4) 3* Lachichuk
		
		"Ignore any skill cards? Enter the number of those you don't want to search - enter 0 when ready to proceed:  "
	
If we didn't want to search a specific card, we would just type the number next to its name and hit enter; entering "0" when ready to proceed. The
program requires at least one card from a set of N support ability cards to be searched, so you may only ignore up to (N-1) cards from a given set.


If we were enforcing a minimum skill level with Ambush, we would next see:

		"Set minimum skill level (1 2 3):  "
		
The numbers in parentheses are the levels available for the selected skill - simply type in the desired minimum level and hit enter to progress. This
line will not appear for skills with only one level.


Once finished with all of our skills, we would next be prompted to set a minimum number of matching types for a card to possess in order for it to be
included in the search:
		
		"Enter the minimum number of matching types per card: "
		
This value can range from 0 to 6 (the present maximum number of types on any card). The program will not proceed until a valid integer is entered.


Next we would see

		"Query through which rarity (5 4 3 2 1)? : "
		
Enter the rarity through which you want to search. Entering "5" would cause the program to search only 5*; entering "4" would cause it to search only
5* and 4*; and so on.


And lastly, we would be prompted to: 
		
		"Stop searching after a certain number of solutions? (Yes = 1):  "
		
If you want to stop after discovering some solutions, enter "1" and then enter the number of solutions for which you want to search. Otherwise enter
any other value.

And with that, the program will commence its solving of your support deck. Once it has completed, it will printout onto the screen if it managed to
find any combinations; and if no solutions are found, it will printout the skill names, minimum enforced levels, and total cards used for which it
tried to solve.
